of that making period.

# What is debugging?

Debugging or Troubleshooting is the proccess of fixing unoticed problem or just problems in you code in general. That sounds light and easy right? lol i thought so too
because its not the idea thats hard its the fact that there are multiple different errors and different fixes for them so toubleshooting suddenly doesnt feel like a . regular task it feels like playing chess and memorizing all openings a defenses.

# Errors and Error types 

Remember when i said there were multiple different erors and error fixes yeah there is allot one of the more tame ones and pesonallythe esiest to deal with is syntax errors.
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>SYNTAX ERRORS</h2>

- syntax errors are the errors you get when you type out code that goes against the rules of the coding language you use in this case we use python.

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

<p></p>
<p></p>
Another error that could be petty tricky when it comes to trouble shooting or debugging is logical errors.

<h2>LOGICAL ERRORS</h2>

Logical errors occur when you apply incorrectlogic to your program and get an unexpected result from it.

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

 <p></p>

One of the more inteesting ones are Runtime errors.

<h2>RUNTIME ERRORS</h2>
 
A Runtime eror is when your code stops at an eror and does not register as a syntax error. 

<h2>EXAMPLE>

 ![EXAMPLE  #3](images/runtime.png "runtime error")
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

The most self explanitory and kind of funny ones are user errors.

<h2>USER ERRORS</h2>

A user error is when the user makes a mistakes inputting or typing in the wrong character or what we call values into a pogram or terminal.

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

 ![EXAMPLE  #4](images/User.png "user error")

so basically you typed in the wrong thing skill issue we have all been there.

ive been through all these problems and error s through my time debugging and troubleshooting and with these problrms being highlighted i end my blog here .
